Hello! I am TheeViolet, and I am interested in video games, occasional soccer, and FIRST robotics. I play Fortnite, Rocket League, some Pokemon games, Geometry Dash, and Minecraft(rarely). My favorite animals are my 2 dogs, Emery and Norah, and I am most of the time available. (Also, thank goodness the armadillo won the mob vote for Minecraft, Woohoo!) Thanks 4 stopping by!
